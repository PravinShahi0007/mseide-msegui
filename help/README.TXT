MSEgui API Documentation, in source format, can be found in the `fpdoc`
sub-directory. See the `help/fpdoc/README.txt` file for more details.


More user contributed documentation can also be found in the `mseuniverse`
repository, under the following directories:

  /docs/
  /attic/msedocumenting/

The status and validity of the documentation in the mseuniverse repo can
not be verified, but there might be some useful information that could be
incorporated into the fpdoc help.
