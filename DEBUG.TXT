MSEide debugging
****************
Breakpoints don't work on win32 in units compiled with -CX
(create smartlinked units). It is recommended to use mingw gdb 6.8+ on win32.
String and dynamic array variables of units compiled with
-gv (Valgrind debug info) are displayed incorrect.
gdb 6.5 has bugs with threads and forking on linux. Please update to gdb 6.6+.
FPC 2.2+ projects must be compiled with -O- (no optimization) for debugging.

Tips from IvankoB:
------------------

In win-32, when debugging MSEide as a slave project run within master
MSEide, there're possible
uncontrollable breakpoints on pressing the F12 key (in MSEide, this key
toggles design/code view
for form, datamodules and reports). These breakpoints are caused by the
win-32 internal debug
facilities activated by the F12 key too. To release this key for MSEide,
there's a solution:

- run the REGEDIT.exe

- set Â 
"HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug\UserDebuggerHotKey"
to 0x2F
(it's the scancode of VK_HELP which is not present on most PC keyboards )

- reboot
